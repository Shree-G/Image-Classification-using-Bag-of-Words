# Image Classification using Bag of Words

## Objective

This project implements image classification using the Bag of Words representation. We do this by first extracting features from an image, creating a visual dictionary, then creating a histogram representation, and then computing classification using a K-nearest neighbors method.

### Skills Learned

-  Developed algorithms for interest point extraction using both uniform and corner sampling methods.
-  Implemented feature extraction methods including SIFT feature extraction and image patch feature extraction.
-  Utilized KMeans clustering algorithm for forming visual vocabularies from extracted features.
-  Implemented histogram generation based on visual vocabularies for image classification tasks.
-  Familiarity with K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification tasks.

### Tools Used

- OpenCV
- Harris Corner Detector Library
- K-means package
- scikit learn
- MatPlotLib
- Numpy
